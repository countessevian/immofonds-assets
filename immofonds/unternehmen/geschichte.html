                The Early Years (1955-1965)
            </h2></header><p>In the first ten years after the end of World War II, Switzerland's population had grown by 0.5 to 5 million people. A short-term "baby boom", the increasing number of immigrants, and higher housing standards stimulated construction activity. While around 11,000 apartments were built in 1946, the number exceeded 31,000 in 1955.</p><p>Overall, the housing market in the 1950s was similar to today. The vacancy rate was sometimes below 0.1 percent. The initially high construction activity declined after 1955 and only recovered towards the end of the decade. The situation was also comparable to today in terms of rent differences. In the city of Zurich, a 3-room apartment in a building built before 1940 cost an average of 1,617 francs in annual rent, 2,115 francs in a building built in 1940, and 2,709 francs in a new building built in 1957. This persuaded many long-term tenants - just as today - to stay in often too-large apartments because they could not afford a modern apartment.</p></div></div>

                Pioneer Spirit
            </h2></header><p>The idea of launching a real estate fund originated, among other places, at the fireplace of one of the founders, Hans Jenny. In 1954, the trustee met in his house with real estate entrepreneur Bruno Stefanini, with whom Jenny had been connected both professionally and personally for several years, and with Hermann Wild from Handelsbank. The three initiators wanted to seize the opportunities that the increasingly attractive real estate market offered to investors.</p><p>At that time, a real estate fund was not a novelty in the Swiss investment universe, but it certainly had rarity value. There were only two known funds of this type, Swissimmobil of Schweizerische Kreditanstalt and SIMA of Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft. Therefore, the initiators saw opportunities in the new establishment of such an investment vehicle for the sale of certificates and for the procurement of profitable real estate. With careful selection of properties and economical administration, certificate holders should be able to obtain a relatively high return that considerably exceeded the mortgage interest rate.</p><p>In September 1954, the initiators agreed to establish AG fÃ¼r Fondsverwaltung (AGFO, now Immofonds Asset Management AG). The purpose of AGFO was to organize and administer a collective investment in real estate. Certificates were to be issued that granted the holder co-ownership of the assets. Handelsbank as trustee handled the money transactions for AGFO. The issuance of subscription certificates for certificates was targeted for January 1955.</p><p>In negotiations with Handelsbank, the initiators, who now included construction entrepreneur Albert LÃ¼ck with his Bau AG, had to navigate several obstacles, which delayed the plan. Meanwhile, competitors had also entered the market with new establishments (La FonciÃ¨re and AGEMIT).</p></div></div>

                Start with Four Properties
            </h2></header><p>In June 1955, the time had come. AG fÃ¼r Fondsverwaltung was founded in Zug for the issuance of IMMOFONDS. It had fully paid-up capital of 3 million francs. Shareholders were Handelsbank, Bau AG, and Messrs. Stefanini/Jenny, each with one third. The first meeting minutes of the Real Estate Investment Trust Committee dates from June 10, 1955. The prospectus for the fund was scheduled for July 1955. By mid-September, 48 subscribers had subscribed to certificates totaling 1.14 million francs. These were mainly customers of Handelsbank from Switzerland and abroad, plus various cantonal banks. Business operations commenced on October 1, 1955.</p><p>By the end of the year, AG fÃ¼r Fondsverwaltung had collected 1.5 million francs. The portfolio with properties in Kilchberg (Stockenstrasse), Winterthur (Lindbergstrasse), and Zurich (Hinterbergstrasse, Susenbergstrasse, picture) was valued at 3.7 million francs. In the first months, numerous acquisition properties were examined. At a meeting in November 1955 alone, 13 properties were summarily reviewed. Properties in Basel (Haltingerstrasse) and in Opfikon (Glattbrugg, Rohrstrasse, Schueppwiesenstrasse) were added to the portfolio.</p></div></div>

                Rapid Growth
            </h2></header><p>The new investment vehicle was in demand. After the first full fiscal year ended in mid-1957, the certificate volume reached almost 3.8 million francs. The purchase of properties proved more difficult. Initially, prices were high, especially land had become more expensive, then the global situation dampened market sentiment. However, by mid-1957, IMMOFONDS managed to expand the portfolio to eight properties with over 300 apartments and a value of 12.6 million francs.</p><p>Five years after its founding, IMMOFONDS had issued almost 25,000 certificates, nearly doubling its inventory within a year. The portfolio value of 1,165 apartments stood at 44 million francs in mid-1960. Certificate demand put pressure on fund management to provide new properties. Between 1960 and 1965, its own construction activity was developed on a contract basis. At times, construction projects worth almost 50 million francs were underway. As a result, the balance sheet value of properties with nearly 3,500 apartments rose to 167 million francs at the end of the tenth fiscal year on June 30, 1965. Certificate volume stood at 106 million francs. After two increases, AGFO's share capital now amounted to 1 million francs. Banca del Gottardo had joined as an additional shareholder.</p></div></div>

                Eventful Years Lead to Stock Exchange Listing (1965-1980)
            </h2></header><p>When IMMOFONDS celebrated its tenth anniversary in 1965, expansionary forces predominated in the Swiss economy. To prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Council submitted two proposals to voters, one of which concerned the development of the construction industry. The approved "Construction Decree" mainly included the introduction of a building permit requirement and a construction freeze for certain buildings deemed non-urgent. IMMOFONDS therefore had to postpone a project for a fifteen-story building in Zug.</p><p>The real estate market subsequently froze. Good properties rarely came onto the market. The returns on many completed houses were unattractive, i.e., insufficient, due to increased mortgage and land prices. In the 1964/65 annual report, fund management expressed concern. The Construction Decree had hit real estate funds hard, and the later subjection of funds to withholding tax was considered a done deal. As a result, the inflow of new money had almost dried up, and certificates had to be bought back on the over-the-counter market. The yield advantage over bonds had shrunk. In short, IMMOFONDS's start into its second decade of life was difficult.</p></div></div>

                Increasing Distribution
            </h2></header><p>Under these difficult conditions, AG fÃ¼r Fondsverwaltung ("AGFO", now Immofonds Asset Management AG) worked in the mid-1960s to optimize the IMMOFONDS portfolio. Gradually, individual properties, especially building land, were sold to strengthen liquidity. Rising rental income and careful investment policy made it possible to continuously increase distributions.</p><p>The new Federal Act on Investment Funds obliged fund management to increase capital in 1968. As a result, share capital increased from 1 to 1.5 million francs as of September 30, 1968. Including creditable reserves, own funds amounted to 1.65 million francs. The shares were subscribed by existing shareholders Handelsbank, Banca del Gottardo, and founders Hans Jenny (VERIT) and Bruno Stefanini. The intrinsic value of IMMOFONDS certificates (NAV) increased slightly for the first time in a long while. After years in which the fund landscape suffered from a bad image due to forced liquidations of speculatively built vehicles, cautious optimism emerged among IMMOFONDS managers for the first time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>

                Liquidity Problems
            </h2></header><p>At the beginning of the 1970s, the construction industry was in full swing, especially residential construction increased. In 1973, 81,865 apartments were completed, a record. However, construction prices also rose significantly, which the real estate industry first had to digest. With the economic downturn following the global oil crisis in 1975, construction output in Switzerland declined for the first time since 1958. After the boom years, there was now an oversupply of new apartments. Among investors, investments in real estate were already less in demand. Redemptions of IMMOFONDS certificates were significantly higher than new subscriptions. Handelsbank and Banca del Gottardo also returned certificates that AGFO had to buy at the expense of fund assets. This reduced liquidity. The price of certificates set by AGFO began to slide.</p></div></div>


<div id="c1138" class="ce ce-text ce-with-container ce-space-before-none ce-space-after-none" ><div class="content-container"><p>On the financing side, higher mortgage interest rates also had to be expected, as well as rising renovation costs in the medium term, as many buildings were reaching renovation age. IMMOFONDS thus entered a financial bottleneck at the end of 1974. Shareholders Handelsbank and Banca del Gottardo would step in with loans if the situation required it. The sale of properties could make its own contribution to improving liquidity, which the AGFO Board of Directors was willing to do. This proved difficult in the tense real estate market, so that a loan from Handelsbank had to be taken out as early as the end of 1975.</p></div></div>

A law named after then Federal Councilor Kurt Furgler (Lex Furgler, later Lex Koller) stipulated that foreign capital was only partially allowed in real estate funds and companies, but a majority in the investment vehicle had to be in Swiss hands. AGFO major shareholder Handelsbank had been taken over by British financial group NatWest and therefore had to sell part of its share package in 1976. Zug Cantonal Bank joined and acquired 11% of AGFO shares, while Handelsbank N.W.'s share was reduced to 29%.</p></div></div>

<div id="c1156" class="ce ce-text ce-with-container ce-space-after-none" ><div class="content-container"><p>Until the 25th anniversary, IMMOFONDS still had some obstacles to overcome. The construction industry recovered only slowly after the 1975 collapse. The real estate market also developed only slowly in a positive direction. The sometimes tight liquidity remained a persistent problem because certificates had to be redeemed repeatedly. The number of certificates fell to 90,000. Only towards the end of 1978 was renewed interest noted in the market. However, demand remained too low to justify a new issue. Moreover, there were hardly any investment opportunities in which IMMOFONDS could have invested fresh capital. At the same time, the fund was operationally struggling with declining earnings.</p></div></div>

                On the Way to Listing
            </h2></header><p>New ideas were needed to prevent a possible further stagnation phase. In August 1979, the AGFO Board of Directors commissioned Handelsbank N.W. to examine a stock exchange listing of IMMOFONDS. Discussion of the listing in the Board of Directors dragged on for several months. The supporting bank representatives argued for improved visibility of the fund, which would appeal to new buyer groups who were only allowed to invest in listed vehicles. They also saw an image gain in the listing, as only funds of proven quality made it to the stock exchange. Skeptical voices pointed to additional costs and, above all, to the fact that the price of certificates would be externally regulated by the market.</p><p>On May 7, 1980, the AGFO Board of Directors decided to bring IMMOFONDS to the stock exchange in September 1980. The decision was made with five yes votes (including Board President Hans Jenny and his deputy Georges Hangartner), one no vote, and one abstention. The listing prospectus was issued in August 1980. The fund started its stock exchange life with net fund assets of 145 million francs. The portfolio then comprised 271 properties with 3,026 apartments and over 1,800 other rental properties (e.g., parking spaces). Target rental income stood at 16.6 million francs.</p></div></div>

            </h2></header><p>The listing of IMMOFONDS in autumn 1980 was welcomed by the market. Interest in the newcomer's papers was lively. However, this was short-lived. Until the end of 1985, the certificates remained in a sideways trend, with the price usually below the intrinsic value of the papers. Liquidity problems were repeatedly an issue, although less serious than in earlier years. Fund management countered by increasing the mortgage portfolio and selling properties. Although the desired strengthening of the portfolio was delayed, rental income was increased from 16.5 to around CHF 21 million francs by 1985, with adjustments for inflation accounting for a considerable share.</p><p>By the middle of the decade, the Swiss real estate market gained momentum. Interest rates were favorable, construction boomed accordingly, and demand for apartment buildings was high. Transaction prices and land prices rose. In early 1985, AGFO fund management considered a new issue for the first time; in July 1986 it happened. Further new issues followed until April 1989, when 120,000 certificates were in circulation.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a time of boom, driven by speculative investments, favorable credit conditions, and generally optimistic market sentiment. Moreover, after the 1987 stock market crash, many investors had turned their backs on the stock market and turned to the real estate market.&nbsp;</p></div></div>

The increased interest rate level posed refinancing problems for banks.

<div id="c1197" class="ce ce-text ce-with-container" ><div class="content-container"><p>For IMMOFONDS, the situation came to a head in autumn 1990. Investors rapidly divested their papers in quick succession. The pool financed by AGFO shareholders could no longer absorb the returns. Fund management was forced to redeem certificates. To finance these extensive repurchases in tranches, those responsible took two measures. Some poorly performing properties were sold or at least placed on the sales list. However, this was not enough, so additional mortgages were taken out at the same time. 20 million francs each flowed into the coffers through both measures. In addition, major renovation projects were put on ice to reduce operational funding needs.&nbsp;</p><p>On the stock exchange, IMMOFONDS papers found hardly any buyers in the "year of upheaval 1991/92", as AGFO Board member Bruno Stefanini called it. Other funds struggled with the same problems. They too suffered from redemption waves, and new issues were extremely rare.&nbsp;</p><p>The drought period lasted another two years for IMMOFONDS. Operationally, respectable results were achieved each time, mainly thanks to rental income rising due to inflation and the renunciation of major renovation projects. However, the mortgage interest burden increased and profits declined. To keep investors engaged, an investor-friendly distribution policy was implemented. Nevertheless, further redemptions had to be launched, which again had to be financed from property sales. Only in autumn 1993 did the situation stabilize enough for a subscription rights issue to be successfully implemented. The stock price subsequently rose to a high of 3,470 francs.&nbsp;</p></div></div>

The issue of foreign control of IMMOFONDS also resurfaced. It was elegantly resolved with the transfer of Banca del Gottardo's AGFO shares to its pension vehicle Gestivalor-Gestione Fondi.&nbsp;</p><p>In spring 1992, Coutts reduced its commitment by selling part of its AGFO shares to co-shareholders. In fiscal year 1994/95, Zug Cantonal Bank replaced Coutts as depository bank. The successor to the IMMOFONDS founding bank remained on board as a shareholder until the end of 1998. After that, Zug Cantonal Bank and Verit (Jenny family) each held 26.8 percent of AGFO shares, the Foundation for Art, Culture and History (Bruno Stefanini) held 23 1/3 percent, and Gestivalor-Gestione Fondi (Banca del Gottardo) held just over 23 percent.</p></div></div>

Long-term orientation was emphasized; a short-term oriented earnings policy was out of the question.</p></div></div>

<div id="c1203" class="ce ce-text ce-with-container" ><div class="content-container"><p>On this basis, IMMOFONDS started into the second half of the 1990s. Operational performance was solid. Through new issues, the volume approached 116,000 certificates in circulation in spring 1998, approaching the previous high (120,000) for the first time. Shortly thereafter, a 1:10 split improved the tradability of the securities. To meet the requirements of the Federal Banking Commission for fund management, Verit established an office with 150 percent positions in the same year, shared by Erwin HÃ¤felin as Managing Director and RenÃ© Foschi as Secretary, as well as two other people.</p></div></div>

<div id="c1205" class="ce ce-text ce-with-container" ><div class="content-container"><p>In the same year, the AGFO Board of Directors faced the question of how to manage the renovation expenditure with investments of 90 million francs over the next four to five years. Neither the substance nor the earning power of IMMOFONDS should be impaired; on the contrary, it should be significantly strengthened. In the medium term, AGFO set itself the goal in "Strategy 200X" of advancing IMMOFONDS to the top 3 real estate investment funds. An increase in net fund assets (as of June 30, 2000: 400 million francs) by around two-thirds was seen as realistic. Regular issues and better use of debt financing potential were to help achieve this. An ambitious undertaking with which IMMOFONDS started into the new millennium. The declining interest of investors in indirect real estate investments and the loss of Banca del Gottardo as a shareholder - it was taken over by Rentenanstalt - made the task even more difficult.</p></div></div>
